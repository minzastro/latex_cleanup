existence	detect the existence of X	detect X	See Sect. 7.1.1.
fact	the fact that X possibility; the fact that X can be	the possiblity that X is	Avoid “fact that” if it does not refer to an actual fact. The trick is to find the word or idea in what follows to find what can replace (e.g., possibility, see 5.3.3.).

last	in the last years	in recent years; in past years; in the last decade of the last century (20th).	“recent” is what is meant, but “past” is fine since it also refers to the same time period; however, “last” should be reserved for the end of an earlier period that ended before now.
like	like, for instance,…	such as, similar to, the same as	See Sect. 7.

order	on the order of a few; of the order of ~X	of a few; close to X; on the order of N; comparable to;	This multi-word phrase means “approximately”, so avoid redundancy and use with a single measurement (N), not an object that has been measured (X).
